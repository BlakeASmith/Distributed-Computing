<li><p>minimize network traffic, every request/response increases the probability of failure</p></li>

</ul>
<p>When a process  A stores information that cannot be reconstructed it can pose a problem to
the distributed system. Other processes must go A for that data, A becomes a single point
of failiure. So A’s data must be replicated somewhere else as a backup, but then we have
problems with managing the changes of that data between the replicated sources. This
presents a trade-off between accessability of the data (the ability to procure it at all)
and acccuracy of the data.</p>

<dd class="field-odd"><p>Have you ever encountered a Heisenbug? How did you isolate and fix it</p>
</dd>
</dl>
<hr class="docutils" />
<blockquote>
<div><p>I’m currently working on a text-processing library for recognizing patterns within
plain text documents and converting them into python objects. Similarly to what
we can already do with JSON but for any format. It uses a string template to define a
‘text object’ which can then be recognized in text and it’s various attributes extracted
from the text. This allows any arbitrary data to be read as if it were structured data.</p>
<p>Repeated function composition is used to alter the matching behaviour as the template
string is read. The ultimate result is a function which takes a string as input and
returns an object with attributes matching the placholders in the template string.
There is also recursion involved in this process so it can become somewhat difficult
to reason about.</p>
<p>I ran into a problem in which the same string template would match a peice of text
most of the time, except when it didn’t. This only happened about 1/10 times and it
was unclear how to repoduce the bug.</p>
<p>My first approach was to log the current remaining text along with the next sub-pattern
being considered. I ran a script to attemt the match a few thousand times and used grep
to get all the lines at which the match failed.</p>
<p>I found that in the faliure cases the pattern being considered did not occur until
much farther along in the template, but was for some reason being attempted early.</p>
<p>I isolated the bug to one specific function which was responsible for handling the
<cite>search</cite> modifer which allows a placholder to be searched for in the text as apposed
to directly matching the beginning. However there was no indication of what was
going wrong, and that routine worked in every case I tried to put it through</p>
<p>Ultimiatley I found that the bug had nothing to do with the routine itself but with
how the arguments were supplied. Within the routine a wrapper function was defined to
add the searching functionallity. The current regex pattern being considered was an
argument to the enclosing function, and was available to the wrapper function through
the enclosing scope (closure). It turns out that python uses late-binding, meaning that
the wrapper function was accessing the value as it was when the wrapper function
was <strong>invoked</strong>, where as it needed to access the value as it was at the time when the
wrapper function was <strong>defined</strong>. Thus the problem came from the value of that pattern
variable changing between the time that the function was defined and the time that the
function was invoked</p>
<p>Placeholders can be marked as <cite>optional</cite>. If this is the case then the template string
is evaluated both with and without the placeholder (concurrently).
The template string in question
that was having the inconsistant behavior had several of these optional placeholders.
It turned out that in most cases, the late-binding did not cause a problem because in
the order in which these branches happened to return that specific wrapper
function was the last one to be composed with the output function,
thus the value of the pattern variable did not change. However some of the time the
branches would return in a different order, resulting in the bug manifesting</p>
<p>The solution was to add <cite>pattern=pattern</cite> in the arguments to the wrapper function.</p>

<dt class="field-odd">Q2</dt>
<dd class="field-odd"><p>What is the difference between caching and data replication</p>
</dd>
</dl>
<hr class="docutils" />
<blockquote>
<div><p>cached data has an expiration date and is not syncronized to the main dataset.
typically cached data will only be updated when it is requested. In contrast
data replication aims to keep the replicated data in the same state as the
data which is being replicated. If cached data is continually updated to match
the service data, then that is data replication and not caching. Caching and data
replication also differ in purpose. Caching is something you do to improve speed when
the same data is requested multiple times (you trade accuracy of the data for speed).
In contrast data replication aims to improve accessabiltiy/availability of the data
(in the case that another node fails) and can create overhead (keeping the data in
sync). Caching has the effect of reducing the number of requests sent over the network
as nodes will use the local cache in place of making a request to another node if
possible. Data replication may have effect of increasing the number of requests in the
network as additional packets must be transmitted to manage the syncronization
of the data.</p>
